            <p id="rep"> I consider that Nebojsa Zivkovic website is a good exmaple of repetition, because at every section you can see a reference to his name. You have many options, but all of them have the reference to his last name.
            </p>
            <p id="hick">For me Come unto Christ page, from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints website,  is a good example of Hick's Law and also of Fitt's Law, because it is very clear that it is a missionary site, and it offers three basic menu buttons, although that there are many functionalities at the navigation bar.For me it is a very clear reference that less is more and that if the buttons are more accesible it will be easier for the user to interact. </p>
            <p id="white">Dell Technologies site is a very good example of white space, they show you their bussiness, with big images, and some supporting material, but it is a very clear site. They have lots of space between the image and the information. It is a serious type of site, but if you scroll you can find some movement in the design.  </p>
